## Create Shift Modal Implementation

### Summary
I have successfully implemented a Create Shift modal that is identical in style and functionality to the role module rights modal. Here's what has been implemented:

### Features Implemented:

1. **Modal Structure**: 
   - Identical styling to role-module-rights modal
   - Responsive design with proper RTL/LTR support
   - Overlay with blur effect and slide-in animation

2. **Form Fields**:
   - **Toggle for Two Parts**: Checkbox to enable/disable Part 2 section
   - **Basic Information**: Arabic and English name inputs (required)
   - **7 Weekday Dropdowns**: Single select dropdowns for each day (Sunday-Saturday)
     - Options: Working Day (1), Off Day (0), Holiday (2)
     - Searchable with language-aware labels

3. **Part 1 Section** (Always visible):
   - Toggle for "Open Shift" (shows minutes input when enabled)
   - Toggle for "Two Days"
   - **In Section**: Time picker (required) + 4 optional number inputs (Early In, In Allow, Max In, Overtime In)
   - **Out Section**: Time picker (required) + 4 optional number inputs (Early Out, Out Allow, Max Out, Overtime Out)

4. **Part 2 Section** (Conditional - only shows when "Two Parts" is enabled):
   - Same structure as Part 1
   - All fields are optional for Part 2

5. **Active Status**: Checkbox for isActive

6. **Form Submission**: 
   - Calls `createShift()` from ShiftsService
   - Passes current language (ar=2, en=1)
   - Proper validation and error handling
   - Success/error messages in both languages

### Technical Implementation:

1. **TypeScript Component**:
   - Added imports for Validators and CreatShift interface
   - Added modal state properties
   - Implemented form initialization with reactive forms
   - Added modal open/close methods
   - Implemented form submission with proper data mapping
   - Added weekday options as getter for language reactivity

2. **HTML Template**:
   - Added complete modal structure with all form sections
   - Conditional rendering for Part 2 based on "Two Parts" toggle
   - Conditional rendering for "Open Shift Minutes" inputs
   - Proper form validation and accessibility
   - RTL/LTR support for Arabic/English

3. **CSS Styles**:
   - Complete modal styling identical to role-module-rights
   - Grid layouts for responsive design
   - Form styling with focus states
   - Animation and transition effects
   - Mobile responsive breakpoints

4. **Internationalization**:
   - Added 30+ new translation keys to both en.json and ar.json
   - All UI labels, placeholders, and messages are translatable
   - Language-aware dropdown options

### Usage:
1. Click the "Create Shift" button in the shifts table
2. Fill in the required fields (Arabic name, English name, weekdays, Part 1 in/out times)
3. Optionally enable "Two Parts" to show Part 2 section
4. Optionally enable "Open Shift" to show minutes input
5. Submit the form to create the shift

The implementation correctly maps all form data to the CreatShift interface and calls the existing shiftsService.createShift() method with the current language setting.
